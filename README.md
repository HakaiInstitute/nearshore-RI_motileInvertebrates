In light of the effort required to create data packages, we request that in
addition to following the CC-BY license terms, that users 1) respect the data

## Summary

This data package is a component of the Hakai Institute’s Nearshore 
research and monitoring program. The overarching objective of Hakai Nearshore 
research is to investigate the role of habitats and their associated 
communities, in the face of stress and disturbances from global climate change 
and local coastal perturbations. 

The Rocky Intertidal program is a subset of Hakai Nearshore, and is designed to 
quantify change in rocky shore intertidal habitats and their associated 
communities. Please see the list of all Rocky Intertidal program data packages 
here:

## Survey Methods

This data package collects data and information relating to mobile 
invertebrate surveys conducted in the rocky intertidal of Calvert Island BC, 
starting in 2016. Surveys were conducted using 5 permanent plots at each site, 
wherein motile invertebrate abundances were recorded within the whole plot and 
using smaller subplots. For a detailed description, please see the Rocky 
Intertidal protocol contained in this dataset.

## Resources

See the data dictionary file for a complete description of data variables, 
units and descriptions.

- ***Data*** 
	- **motile_inverts-surveys.csv:** Counts of mobile invertebrate species 
	quantified within a set area (subplot_size), with size measurements for select 
	species. Associated with fucus, mussel or barnacle primary habitat (plot_type). 
	Individual plots are repeated across time.

- ***Protocols:***
	- **rocky_intertidal-protocol.pdf:** Detailed description of field survey 
	methods and equipment. 	

## OBIS Translation

The "obis" folder within the repository contains files related to translating a 
subset of the raw survey data into a format that can be shared with the 
**O**cean **B**iodiversity **I**nformation **S**ystem (https://obis.org/), and 
should be disregarded for other uses.  The same can be said for the 
**nearshore-RI_motileInvertebrates.Rproj** file in the main repository. None of
these files contain different data from the basic survey data found in the 
"data" folder.
